				<p class="about-p">
					Hello, I am Michael! Let me tell you about myself. After 10 years of
					providing customer service, I have decided to change careers and enter
					the world of technology. Near the end of 2021, I made the decision to
					move to LA and enter into General Assembly's Software Engineering
					Immersive course. Since then I have picked up front-end and back-end
					skills across several different tech stacks. More importantly, I
					discovered my passion for learning and exploring how to use new
					technologies. That has put me on the road towards new and exciting
					goals with a full tank of gas.

					<h3>Build-A-Farm</h3>
					<p>
						Build-A-Farm was a group project that took first place built during
						a three day hackathon where the theme was accessibility in education
						technologies. It was built using a MERN stack. My contributions to
						the project included being the bridge between designers and
						developers, building out several React components, implementing some
						simple game logic for Cow Mania and creating some dynamically
						rendered components based on the game logic.

					<h3>Bad Interview</h3>
					<p>
						Bad Interview was full-stack solo project designed as an interview
						practice tool. Users could start sessions, choose a number of
						questions they would like to see, and input their answers. There
						were a few hurdles I had to overcome in this project. One example
						was I had to figure out how to ensure the user doesn't get the same
						question multiple times in a session. This application was built
						using a MERN stack.

					<h3>Book Roulette</h3>
					<p>
						Book Roulette was a group based MERN stack project built in three
						days to provide users with a book recommendation tool. Users select
						the genre that they are interested in and a random book from the
						database is recommended. I worked on the front-end, developing
						several React components, writing JavaScript to provide the "random"
						functionality, and contributed heavily during the planning phase.

						Team Deets is a match analysis tool for the computer game League of

						multiple third-party APIs and reusable React components.

					<h3>Baby Gandalph</h3>
					<p>
						Proudly presenting my very first project, Baby Gandalph. Baby
						Gandalph is a browser-based clicking game based off the classic
						"Tamagachi" game. Users input a bit of data to make their experience
						a bit more dynamic. They then have to keep their character from
						becoming too tired, or hungry while training their skills at the
						same time to level up and grow stronger. This application was made
						using an Object Oriented Programming approach, JQuery, HTML5 and
						CSS3.
